**Project Overview**
This project uses Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression models to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various patient attributes. The system selects the most precise prediction by comparing the confidence scores from both models and using the one with higher confidence.
Features
**Input Parameters:**
Gender, Age, Education Level, Smoking status, Cigarettes per day, BP medication, History of stroke, Hypertension, Diabetes, Total cholesterol, Systolic BP, Diastolic BP, BMI, Heart rate, and Glucose level.
**Models Used:**
Random Forest Classifier
Logistic Regression
**Prediction Logic:**
Both models make predictions with confidence scores.
The model with the higher confidence score gives the final prediction.
